## About
Robust fault detection system using YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm, tailored specifically for the identification of defects in bottles. Object detection algorithms, such as YOLO (You Only Look Once), have gained prominence due to their ability to simultaneously detect and classify Fault bottles within images or video frames in real-time. 
YOLOv8, an evolution of the YOLO architecture, offers enhanced performance in terms of accuracy, speed, and generalization capabilities, making it well-suited for industrial applications such as fault detection in manufacturing processes.
The primary objective of this research is to design and implement a fault detection system capable of accurately identifying  faults in bottles and count the number of objects in the video frame  or in the image in real time application. 
By automating the fault detection process, manufacturers can streamline their operations, reduce production costs, and enhance overall product quality and consumer satisfaction.
